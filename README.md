Visualization has always been a key element in Data Science. It is an enabler to view the data from a perspective that fits all the stakeholders. In this project, we have explored visualization using Matplotlib.
This project will not plot only what you see in the data set in the raw format, but will also depict the formulated information derived from the dataset.
The modulated approach of using the functions helps to reuse the code for different combination of features.
I also used trhe loops and condition checks to ensure the data is being filtered and depicted as per the expectation.
Also, the correct grouping of the dataset fetched accurate and optimized results.
